The idea that I have for constructing this project is as follows:

Project able to save and load user's recipes

Necessary features:
Ask for user to enter a name or account name
(Optional) Obtain a password for account
Create a file to store information the user has entered
Create a format and/or parser to read from a file and save to a file in a particular fashion
Create functions that allow user to add, edit, or remove information in his or her account
Use a list or dictionary in a class to hold and traverse the data in the user's account
Have prompts to guide user through adding recipes.(How long a cook time, how many steps, what ingredients?)
Provide a grocery list function that lets the user track what they have on-hand, and what more ingredients they need.
Print functionality for grocery list.
Access to a menu that will list all entered recipes.
Favorite recipes option/list
Account recovery protocol for forgotten passwords, backup identification
